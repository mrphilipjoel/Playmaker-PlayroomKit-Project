This is a complete Unity Project that should allow you to use Playmaker and PlayroomKit together, and quickly export to WebGL.

After opening Project, you'll need to install your copy of PlayMaker from Unity Package Manager.
Before Importing Playmaker, make sure Assets/PlayMaker/Resources/PlayMakerGlobals.asset is unchecked so it doesn't get imported.
If you do accidentally import it, just replace that file with the one in this repo.

You will also want to import the latest PlayroomKit Unity SDK from here:
